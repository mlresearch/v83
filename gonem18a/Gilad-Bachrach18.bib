abstract  = {We consider the challenge of differentially private PCA. 
Currently known methods for this task either employ the computationally intensive
exponential mechanism or require an access to the covariance matrix,
and therefore fail to utilize potential sparsity of the data. The problem of
designing simpler and more efficient methods for this task has been
raised as an open problem in Kapralov et al. 

In this paper we address this problem by employing the output
perturbation mechanism. Despite being arguably the simplest and most
straightforward technique, it has been overlooked due to
the large global sensitivity associated with publishing the
leading eigenvector. We tackle this issue by adopting a smooth sensitivity based 
approach, which allows us to
establish differential privacy (in a worst-case manner) and
near-optimal sample complexity results under eigengap assumption. We
consider both the pure and the approximate  notions of differential privacy, and demonstrate a tradeoff between privacy level and sample complexity. We conclude by
suggesting how our results can be extended to related problems.}
