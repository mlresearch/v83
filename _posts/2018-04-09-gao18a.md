title: "On the Help of Bounded Shot Verifiers, Comparators and Standardisers\r for
  Learnability in Inductive Inference"
abstract: "The present paper deals with the inductive inference of recursively enumerable\r
  languages from positive data (also called text). \r It introduces the learning models
  of \\emph{verifiability} and \r \\emph{comparability}. The input to a verifier is
  an index $e$ and a text of\r the target language $L$, and the learner has to \\emph{verify}
  whether or not\r the index $e$ input is correct for the target language $L$. A comparator\r
  receives two indices of languages from the target class $\\cL$ as input and\r has
  to decide in the limit whether or not these indices generate the same\r language.
  Furthermore, \\emph{standardisability} is studied, where a\r \\emph{standardiser}
  receives an index $j$ of some target language $L$ from\r the class $\\cL$, and for
  every $L∈\\cL$ there must be an index $e$ such\r that $e$ generates $L$ and the
  standardiser has to map every index $j$ \r for $L$ to $e$.\r Additionally, the common
  learning models of \\emph{explanatory learning},\r \\emph{conservative explanatory
  learning}, and \\emph{behaviourally correct learning}\r are considered. For almost
  all learning models mentioned above it is also\r appropriate to consider the number
  of times a learner changes its mind.\r In particular, if no mind change occurs then
  we obtain the \\emph{finite} variant\r of the models considered. Occasionally, also
  learning with the help of an oracle\r is taken into consideration.\r The main goal
  of this paper is to figure out to what extent \r verifiability, comparability, and
  standardisability are helpful for the\r inductive inference of classes of recursively
  enumerable languages. \r Here we also distinguish between \\emph{indexed families},
  \\emph{one-one enumerable\r classes}, and \\emph{recursively enumerable classes}.
  \r Our results are manyfold, and an almost complete picture is obtained. In particular,\r
  for indexed families and recursively enumerable classes finite comparability,\r
  finite standardisability, and finite verifiability always imply finite\r learnability.
  If at least one mind change is allowed, then there are \r differences,\r i.e., for
  indexed families, comparability or verifiability imply conservative explanatory
  learning, but\r standardisability does not; still explanatory learning can be achieved."
