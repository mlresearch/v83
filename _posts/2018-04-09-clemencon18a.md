title: 'Ranking Median Regression: Learning to Order through Local Consensus'
abstract: 'This article is devoted to the problem of predicting the value taken by
  a random permutation $Σ$, describing the preferences of an individual over a set
  of numbered items $\{1,; \ldots,;{n}\}$ say, based on the observation of an input/explanatory
  r.v. $X$ (\textit{e.g.} characteristics of the individual), when error is measured
  by the Kendall’s $τ$ distance. In the probabilistic formulation of the ’Learning
  to Order’ problem we propose, which extends the framework for statistical Kemeny
  ranking aggregation developped in \citet{CKS17}, this boils down to recovering conditional
  Kemeny medians of $Σ$ given $X$ from i.i.d. training examples $(X_1, \Sigma_1),;
  \ldots,; (X_N, \Sigma_N)$. For this reason, this statistical learning problem is
  referred to as \textit{ranking median regression} here. Our contribution is twofold.
  We first propose a probabilistic theory of ranking median regression: the set of
  optimal elements is characterized, the performance of empirical risk minimizers
  is investigated in this context and situations where fast learning rates can be
  achieved are also exhibited. Next we introduce the concept of local consensus/median,
  in order to derive efficient methods for ranking median regression. The major advantage
  of this local learning approach lies in its close connection with the widely studied
  Kemeny aggregation problem. From an algorithmic perspective, this permits to build
  predictive rules for ranking median regression by implementing efficient techniques
  for (approximate) Kemeny median computations at a local level in a tractable manner.
  In particular, versions of $k$-nearest neighbor and tree-based methods, tailored
  to ranking median regression, are investigated. Accuracy of piecewise constant ranking
  median regression rules is studied under a specific smoothness assumption for $Σ$’s
  conditional distribution given $X$. The results of various numerical experiments
  are also displayed for illustration purpose.'
