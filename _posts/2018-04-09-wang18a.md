title: Efficient coordinate-wise leading eigenvector computation
abstract: We develop and analyze efficient "coordinate-wise" methods for finding the
  leading eigenvector, where each step involves only a vector-vector product.  We
  establish global convergence with overall runtime guarantees that are at least as
  good as Lanczosâ€™s method and dominate it for slowly decaying spectrum. Our methods
  are based on combining a shift-and-invert approach with coordinate-wise algorithms
  for linear regression.
