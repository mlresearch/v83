title: Clustering Algorithms for the Centralized and Local Models
abstract: "We revisit the problem of finding a minimum enclosing ball with differential
  privacy: Given a set of $n$ points in the $d$-dimensional Euclidean space and an
  integer $tâ‰¤n$,\r the goal is to find a ball of the smallest radius $r_{opt}$ enclosing
  at least $t$ input points. The problem is motivated by its various applications
  to differential privacy, including the sample and aggregate technique, private data
  exploration, and clustering. \r Without privacy concerns, minimum enclosing ball
  has a polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS), which computes a ball of radius
  almost $r_{opt}$ (the problem is NP-hard to solve exactly). In contrast, under differential
  privacy, until this work, only a $O(\\sqrt{\\log n})$-approximation algorithm was
  known. \r We provide new constructions of differentially private algorithms for
  minimum enclosing ball achieving constant factor approximation to $r_{opt}$ both
  in the centralized model (where a trusted curator collects the sensitive information
  and analyzes it with differential privacy) and in the local model (where each respondent
  randomizes her answers to the data curator to protect her privacy). \r We demonstrate
  how to use our algorithms as a building block for approximating $k$-means in both
  models."
