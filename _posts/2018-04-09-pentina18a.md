title: Multi-task {K}ernel {L}earning Based on {P}robabilistic {L}ipschitzness
abstract: 'In multi-task learning the learner is given data for a set of related learning
  tasks and aims to improve the overall learning performance by transferring information
  between them. A typical assumption exploited in this setting is that the tasks share
  a beneficial representation that can be learned form the joint training data of
  all tasks. This way, the training data of each task can be utilized to enhance the
  learning of other tasks in the set. Probabilistic Lipschitzness (PL) is a parameter
  that reflects one way in which some data representation can be beneficial for a
  classification learning task. In this work we propose to achieve multi-task learning
  by learning a kernel function relative to which each of the tasks in the set has
  a "high level" of probabilistic Lipschitzness. In order to be able to do that, we
  need to introduce a new variant of PL - one that allows reliable estimation of its
  value from finite size samples. We show that by having access to large amounts of
  training data in total (possibly the union of training sets for various tasks),
  the learner can identify a kernel function that would lead to fast learning rates
  per task when used for Nearest Neighbor classification or in a cluster-based active
  labeling procedure. '
