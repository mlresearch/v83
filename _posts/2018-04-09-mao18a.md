title: Minimax Rates and Efficient Algorithms for Noisy Sorting
abstract: There has been a recent surge of interest in studying permutation-based
  models for ranking from pairwise comparison data. Despite being structurally richer
  and more robust than parametric ranking models, permutation-based models are less
  well understood statistically and generally lack efficient learning algorithms.
  In this work, we study a prototype of permutation-based ranking models, namely,
  the noisy sorting model. We establish the optimal rates of learning the model under
  two sampling procedures. Furthermore, we provide a fast algorithm to achieve near-optimal
  rates if the observations are sampled independently. Along the way, we discover
  properties of the symmetric group which are of theoretical interest.
