title: Bandit Regret Scaling with the Effective Loss Range
abstract: "We study how the regret guarantees of nonstochastic multi-armed \r bandits
  can be improved, if the effective range of the losses in each round is \r small
  (for example, the maximal difference between two losses or in a given \r round).
  Despite a recent impossibility result, we show how this can be made \r possible
  under certain mild additional assumptions, such as availability of \r rough estimates
  of the losses, or knowledge of the loss of a single, possibly \r unspecified arm,
  at the end of each round. Along the way, we develop a novel \r technique which might
  be of independent interest, to convert any multi-armed \r bandit algorithm with
  regret depending on the loss range, to an algorithm with \r regret depending only
  on the effective range, while attaining better regret \r bounds than existing approaches."
