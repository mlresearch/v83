title: A Better Resource Allocation Algorithm with Semi-Bandit Feedback
abstract: "We study a sequential resource allocation problem between a fixed\r number
  of arms. On each iteration the algorithm distributes a\r resource among the arms
  in order to maximize the expected success\r rate. Allocating more of the resource
  to a given arm increases the\r probability that it succeeds, yet with a cut-off.
  We follow\r \\cite{LCS} and assume that the probability increases\r linearly until
  it equals one, after which allocating more of the\r resource is wasteful. These
  cut-off values are fixed and unknown to\r the learner. We present an algorithm for
  this problem and\r prove a regret upper bound of $O(\\log n)$ improving over the
  best\r known bound of $O(\\log^2 n)$. Lower bounds we prove show that our\r upper
  bound is tight. Simulations demonstrate the superiority of our\r algorithm."
