title: A Better Resource Allocation Algorithm with Semi-Bandit Feedback
abstract: "We study a sequential resource allocation problem between a fixed number
  of arms. On each iteration the algorithm distributes a resource among the arms
  in order to maximize the expected success rate. Allocating more of the resource
  to a given arm increases the probability that it succeeds, yet with a cut-off.
  We follow Lattimore et al (2014) and assume that the probability increases linearly until
  it equals one, after which allocating more of the resource is wasteful. These
  cut-off values are fixed and unknown to the learner. We present an algorithm for
  this problem and prove a regret upper bound of $O(\\log n)$ improving over the
  best known bound of $O(\\log^2 n)$. Lower bounds we prove show that our upper
  bound is tight. Simulations demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm."
