title: Learning Decision Trees with Stochastic Linear Classifiers
abstract: In this work we propose a top-down decision tree learning algorithm with
  a class of linear classifiers called stochastic linear classifiers as the internal
  nodesâ€™ hypothesis class. To this end, we derive efficient algorithms for minimizing
  the Gini index for this class for each internal node, although the problem is non-convex.
  Moreover, the proposed algorithm has a theoretical guarantee under the weak stochastic
  hypothesis assumption.
