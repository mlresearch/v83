title: An Adaptive Strategy for Active Learning with Smooth Decision Boundary
abstract: We present the first adaptive strategy for active learning in the setting
  of classification with smooth decision boundary. The problem of adaptivity (to unknown
  distributional parameters) has remained opened since the seminal work of Castro
  and Nowak (2007), which first established (active learning) rates for this setting.
  While some recent advances on this problem establish \emph{adaptive} rates in the
  case of univariate data, adaptivity in the more practical setting of multivariate
  data has so far remained elusive. Combining insights from various recent works,
  we show that, for the multivariate case, a careful reduction to univariate-adaptive
  strategies yield near-optimal rates without prior knowledge of distributional parameters.
