title: Structure Learning of ${H}$-colorings
abstract: "We study the structure learning problem for $H$-colorings, an important
  class of Markov random fields that capture key combinatorial structures on graphs,
  including proper colorings and independent sets, as well as spin systems from statistical
  physics. The learning problem is as follows: for a fixed (and known) constraint
  graph $H$ with $q$ colors and an unknown graph $G=(V,E)$ with $n$ vertices, given
  uniformly random $H$-colorings of $G$, how many samples are required to learn the
  edges of the unknown graph $G$? We give a characterization of $H$ for which the
  problem is identifiable for every $G$, i.e., we can learn $G$ with an infinite number
  of samples. We also show that there are identifiable constraint graphs for which
  one cannot hope to learn every graph $G$ efficiently.\r We focus particular attention
  on the case of proper vertex $q$-colorings of graphs of maximum degree $d$ where
  intriguing connections to statistical physics phase transitions appear. We prove
  that in the tree uniqueness region (i.e., when $q>d$) the problem is identifiable
  and we can learn $G$ in $\\mathsf{poly}(d,q)\\times O(n^2\\log{n})$ time. In contrast
  for soft-constraint systems, such as the Ising model, the best possible running
  time is exponential in $d$. In the tree non-uniqueness region (i.e., when $q≤d$)
  we prove that the problem is not identifiable and thus $G$ cannot be learned. Moreover,
  when $q<d-\\sqrt{d} + Θ(1)$ we prove that even learning an equivalent graph (any
  graph with the same set of $H$-colorings) is computationally hard—sample complexity
  is exponential in $n$ in the worst case. We further explore the connection between
  the efficiency/hardness of the structure learning problem and the uniqueness/non-uniqueness
  phase transition for general $H$-colorings and prove that under a well-known condition
  in statistical physics, known as the Dobrushin uniqueness condition, we can learn $G$
  in $\\mathsf{poly}(d,q)\\times O(n^2\\log{n})$ time."
