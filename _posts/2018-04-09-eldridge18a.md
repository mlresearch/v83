title: 'Unperturbed: spectral analysis beyond Davis-Kahan'
abstract: "Classical matrix perturbation results, such as Weylâ€™s theorem for\r eigenvalues
  and the Davis-Kahan theorem for eigenvectors, are general\r purpose. These classical
  bounds are tight in the worst case, but in many\r settings sub-optimal in the typical
  case.  In this paper, we present\r perturbation bounds which consider the nature
  of the perturbation and its\r interaction with the unperturbed structure in order
  to obtain significant\r improvements over the classical theory in many scenarios,
  such as when the\r perturbation is random. We demonstrate the utility of these new
  results by\r analyzing perturbations in the stochastic blockmodel where we derive
  much\r tighter bounds than provided by the classical theory."
