title: On Similarity Prediction and Pairwise Clustering
abstract: 'We consider the problem of clustering a finite set of items from pairwise
  similarity information. Unlike what is done in the literature on this subject,  we
  do so in a passive learning setting, and with no specific constraints on the cluster
  shapes other than their size. We investigate the problem in different settings:
  i. an online setting, where we provide a tight characterization of the prediction
  complexity in the mistake bound model, and ii. a standard stochastic batch setting,
  where we give tight upper and lower bounds on the achievable generalization error.
  Prediction performance is measured both in terms of the ability to recover the similarity
  function encoding the hidden clustering and in terms of how well we classify each
  item within the set. The proposed algorithms are time efficient.'
