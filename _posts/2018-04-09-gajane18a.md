title: Corrupt Bandits for Preserving Local Privacy
abstract: We study a variant of the stochastic multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem in
  which the rewards are corrupted. In this framework, motivated by privacy preservation
  in online recommender systems, the goal is to maximize the sum of the (unobserved)
  rewards, based on the observation of transformation of these rewards through a stochastic
  corruption process with known parameters. We provide a lower bound on the expected
  regret of any bandit algorithm in this corrupted setting. We devise a frequentist
  algorithm, KLUCB-CF, and a Bayesian algorithm, TS-CF and give upper bounds on their
  regret. We also provide the appropriate corruption parameters to guarantee a desired
  level of local privacy and analyze how this impacts the regret. Finally, we present
  some experimental results that confirm our analysis.
