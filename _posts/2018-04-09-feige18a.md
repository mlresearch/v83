title: Robust Inference for Multiclass Classification
abstract: "We consider the problem of robust inference in which inputs may be\r maliciously
  corrupted by a powerful adversary, and the learner’s\r goal is to accurately predict
  the original, uncorrupted input’s true\r label given only the adversarially corrupted
  version of the input.\r We specifically focus on the multiclass version of this
  problem in\r which more than two labels are possible. We substantially extend and\r
  generalize previous work which had only considered the binary case,\r thus uncovering
  stark differences between the two cases. We show how\r robust inference can be modeled
  as a zero-sum game between a learner\r who maximizes the expected accuracy, and
  an adversary. The value of\r this game is the best-attainable accuracy rate of any
  algorithm. We\r then show how the optimal policy for both the learner and adversary\r
  can be exactly characterized in terms of a particular hypergraph,\r specifically,
  as the hypergraph’s maximum fractional independent set\r and minimum fractional
  set cover, respectively. This\r characterization yields efficient algorithms in
  the size of the\r domain (number of possible inputs). For the typical setting that
  the\r domain is huge, we also design efficient local computation\r algorithms for
  approximating maximum fractional independent set in\r hypergraphs. This leads to
  a near optimal algorithm for the learner\r whose complexity is independent of the
  domain size, instead\r depending only on the rank and maximum degree of the underlying\r
  hypergraph, and on the desired approximation ratio."
