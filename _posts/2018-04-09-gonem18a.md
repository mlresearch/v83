title: Smooth Sensitivity Based Approach for Differentially Private PCA
abstract: "We consider the challenge of differentially private PCA. \r Currently known
  methods for this task either employ the computationally intensive\r exponential
  mechanism or require an access to the covariance matrix,\r and therefore fail to
  utilize potential sparsity of the data. The problem of\r designing simpler and more
  efficient methods for this task has been\r raised as an open problem in Kapralov
  et al. \r In this paper we address this problem by employing the output\r perturbation
  mechanism. Despite being arguably the simplest and most\r straightforward technique,
  it has been overlooked due to\r the large global sensitivity associated with publishing
  the\r leading eigenvector. We tackle this issue by adopting a smooth sensitivity
  based \r approach, which allows us to\r establish differential privacy (in a worst-case
  manner) and\r near-optimal sample complexity results under eigengap assumption.
  We\r consider both the pure and the approximate  notions of differential privacy,
  and demonstrate a tradeoff between privacy level and sample complexity. We conclude
  by\r suggesting how our results can be extended to related problems."
