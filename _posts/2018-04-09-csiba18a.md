title: 'Coordinate Descent Faceoff: Primal or Dual?'
abstract: "Randomized coordinate descent (RCD) methods are state-of-the-art algorithms
  for training linear predictors via minimizing regularized empirical risk. When the
  number of examples (n) is much larger than the number of features (d), a common
  strategy is to apply RCD to the dual problem. On the other hand, when the number
  of features is much larger than the number of examples, it makes sense to apply
  RCD directly to the primal problem. In this paper we provide the first joint study
  of these two approaches when applied to L2-regularized linear ERM. First, we show
  through a rigorous analysis that for dense data, the above intuition is precisely
  correct. However, we find that for sparse and structured data,  primal RCD can significantly
  outperform dual RCD even if $d << n$, and vice versa, dual RCD can be much faster
  than primal RCD even if $n << d$. Moreover, we show that, surprisingly, a single
  sampling strategy minimizes both the (bound on the) number of iterations and the
  overall expected complexity of RCD. Note that the latter complexity measure also
  takes into account  the average cost of the iterations, which depends on the structure
  and sparsity of the data, and on the sampling strategy employed.  We confirm our
  theoretical predictions using extensive experiments with both synthetic and real
  data sets. \r "
