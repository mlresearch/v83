title: Online Learning of Combinatorial Objects via Extended Formulation
abstract: "\r The standard techniques for online learning of combinatorial objects\r
  perform multiplicative updates followed by projections into the convex hull of all
  the objects.\r However, this methodology can be expensive if the convex hull contains
  many facets.\r For example, the convex hull of $n$-symbol Huffman trees is known
  to have exponentially many facets.\r We get around this difficulty by exploiting
  extended formulations, which encode the polytope of combinatorial objects in a higher
  dimensional “extended” space with only polynomially many facets. We develop a general
  framework for converting extended formulations into efficient online algorithms
  with good relative loss bounds. We present applications of our framework to online
  learning of Huffman trees and permutations.\r The regret bounds of the resulting
  algorithms are within a factor of $\\Ocal(\\sqrt{\\log(n)})$ \r of the state-of-the-art
  specialized algorithms for permutations, \r and depending on the loss regimes, improve
  on or match the state-of-the-art for Huffman trees. \r Our method is general and
  can be applied to other combinatorial objects. "
