title: Sequential prediction with coded side information under logarithmic loss
abstract: We study the problem of sequential prediction with coded side information
  under logarithmic loss (log-loss). We show an operational equivalence between this
  setup and lossy compression with log-loss distortion. Using this insight, together
  with recent work on lossy compression with log-loss, we connect prediction strategies
  with distributions in a certain subset of the probability simplex. This allows us
  to derive a Shtarkov-like bound for regret and to evaluate the regret for several
  illustrative classes of experts. In the present work, we mainly focus on the “batch”
  side information  setting with sequential prediction.
