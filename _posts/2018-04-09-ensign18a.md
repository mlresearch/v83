title: Decision making with limited feedback
abstract: "When models are trained for deployment in decision-making in various real-world\r
  settings, they are typically trained in batch mode. Historical data is used to\r
  train and validate the models prior to deployment. However, in many settings,\r
  \\emph{feedback} changes the nature of the training process. Either the learner\r
  does not get full feedback on its actions, or the decisions\r made by the trained
  model influence what future training data it will see.\r In this paper, we\r focus
  on the problems of recidivism prediction and predictive policing. We\r present the
  first algorithms with provable regret for these problems, by \r showing that both
  problems (and others like these) can be abstracted into a general\r reinforcement
  learning framework called partial monitoring. We also \r discuss the policy implications
  of these solutions.\r "
