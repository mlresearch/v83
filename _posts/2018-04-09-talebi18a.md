title: Variance-Aware Regret Bounds for Undiscounted Reinforcement Learning in MDPs
abstract: "The problem of reinforcement learning in an unknown and discrete Markov
  Decision Process (MDP) under the average-reward criterion is considered, when\r
  the learner interacts with the system in a single stream of observations, starting
  from an initial state without any reset.\r We revisit the minimax lower bound for
  that problem by making appear the local variance of the bias function  in place
  of the diameter of the MDP.\r Furthermore, we provide a novel analysis of the \\texttt{\\textsc{KL-Ucrl}}
  algorithm establishing a high-probability regret bound scaling as\r $\\widetilde
  {\\mathcal O}\\Bigl({\\textstyle \\sqrt{S\\sum_{s,a}{\\bf V}^\\star_{s,a}T}}\\Big)$
  for this algorithm for ergodic MDPs, where $S$ denotes the number of states and\r
  where ${\\bf V}^\\star_{s,a}$ is the variance of the bias function with respect
  to the next-state distribution following action $a$ in state $s$.\r The resulting
  bound improves upon the best previously known regret bound $\\widetilde {\\Ocal}(DS\\sqrt{AT})$
  for that algorithm, where $A$ and $D$ respectively denote\r the maximum number of
  actions (per state) and the diameter of MDP. We finally compare the leading terms
  of the two bounds in some benchmark MDPs indicating\r that the derived bound can
  provide an order of magnitude improvement in some cases. Our analysis leverages
  novel variations of the transportation lemma\r combined with Kullback-Leibler concentration
  inequalities, that we believe to be of independent interest.\r "
