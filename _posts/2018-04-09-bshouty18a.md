title: Adaptive Group Testing Algorithms to Estimate the Number of Defectives
abstract: "We study the problem of estimating the number of defective\r items in adaptive
  Group testing by using a minimum number of queries.\r We improve the existing algorithm
  and prove a lower bound that shows that,\r for constant estimation, the number of
  tests in our algorithm is optimal."
