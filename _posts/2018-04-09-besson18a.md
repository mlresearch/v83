title: "{Multi-Player Bandits Revisited}"
abstract: Multi-player Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB) have been extensively studied in
  the literature, motivated by applications to Cognitive Radio systems. Driven by
  such applications as well, we motivate the introduction of several levels of feedback
  for multi-player MAB algorithms. Most existing work assume that \emph{sensing information}
  is available to the algorithm. Under this assumption, we improve the state-of-the-art
  lower bound for the regret of any decentralized algorithms and introduce two algorithms,
  \emph{RandTopM} and \emph{MCTopM}, that are shown to empirically outperform existing
  algorithms. Moreover, we provide strong theoretical guarantees for these algorithms,
  including a notion of asymptotic optimality in terms of the number of selections
  of bad arms. We then introduce a promising heuristic, called \emph{Selfish}, that
  can operate without sensing information, which is crucial for emerging applications
  to Internet of Things networks. We investigate the empirical performance of this
  algorithm and provide some first theoretical elements for the understanding of its
  behavior.
