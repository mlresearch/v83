title: The K-Nearest Neighbour UCB Algorithm for Multi-Armed Bandits with Covariates
abstract: In this paper we propose and explore the $k$-Nearest Neighbour UCB algorithm
  for multi-armed bandits with covariates. We focus on a setting where covariates
  are supported on a metric space of low intrinsic dimension, such as a manifold embedded
  within a high dimensional ambient feature space. The algorithm is conceptually simple
  and straightforward to implement. Unlike previous methods such as the UCBogram and
  Adaptively Binned Successive Elimination, the $k$-Nearest Neighbour UCB algorithm
  does not require prior knowledge of the intrinsic dimension of the marginal distribution.
  It is also naturally anytime, without resorting to the doubling trick. We prove
  a regret bound for the $k$-Nearest Neighbour UCB algorithm which is minimax optimal
  up to logarithmic factors. In particular, the algorithm automatically takes advantage
  of both low intrinsic dimensionality of the marginal distribution over the covariates
  and low noise in the data, expressed as a margin condition. In addition, focusing
  on the case of bounded rewards, we give corresponding regret bounds for the $k$-Nearest
  Neighbour KL-UCB algorithm, which is an analogue of the KL-UCB algorithm adapted
  to the setting of multi-armed bandits with covariates. Finally, we present empirical
  results which demonstrate the ability of both the $k$-Nearest Neighbour UCB and
  $k$-Nearest Neighbour KL-UCB to take advantage of situations where the data is supported
  on an unknown sub-manifold of a high-dimensional feature space.
